We all have questions. From a young age, children will constantly ask ``why?'' These questions start simple enough, but as we grow older, the questions we have become more abstract and more fundamental to the nature of the world we live in. Despite appearances, all the questions in this textbook, questions we all have, have answers beyond an individual's beliefs. As you work through this course, you will be exposed to the methods used to get the potential answers to these questions as well as the potential answers themselves.

Davis A. Smith is an Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at Pierce College in Lakewood, Washington, USA. Believing that the cost and quality of textbooks are under-discussed obstacles to the accessibility of a course and student success, Davis has written a total of three OER (Open Educational Resource) textbooks. The first is a version of the formal logic textbook \emph{forall x} (called \emph{forall x: $R^3$}), this textbook was his second, and the third is an Introduction to Ethics textbook called \emph{Who Should I Be? What Should I Do?}.  His primary areas of research are in The Mind-Body Problem, The Free Will Debate, and various questions in Philosophy of Language concerning meaning and intent.

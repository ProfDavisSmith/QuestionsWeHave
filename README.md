# Questions We Have
## Description 
Questions We Have by Davis Smith is, for the most part, an original introduction to Philosophy textbook. It consists of eleven (11) Modules (sections or parts) 
which each handle a different philosophical question a person may have wondered about. Aside from the in depth discussions of the various topics which Davis Smith 
provides, there are 11 primary source works which are reprinted into this text (future editions will reduce this to 10 by merging the Libertarianism papers by Davis Smith). The questions discussed span from the abstract, such as the purpose of Philosophy, 
to the concrete, like our moral duties to other people and animals. The questions discussed and primary sources included are, in order:<img style="background-image;width:500px;height:625px" url="https://github.com/ProfDavisSmith/QuestionsWeHave/blob/main/IntroToPhil.pdf" src="https://github.com/ProfDavisSmith/QuestionsWeHave/blob/main/Questions%20We%20Have%20cover%20image%208.png" align="right"/><BR right/>

This work is under **perpetual** development and may change with time. As it sits now, it is a fully functional textbook which is being used at Pierce College, Olympic College, and Bellevue College. 
Currently, it is made for an eleven week course, with the final module (part or section) not being used for a ten week course. 

## About the Author

Davis Smith earned his Master’s Degree in Philosophy from Arizona State University and is an adjunct Philosophy professor at three colleges, Pierce College, Bellevue College, and Olympic College. 
He specializes in teaching introductory level courses. One of his goals in teaching is to make Philosophy
accessible to all people. The cost and quality of textbooks are under-discussed obstacles to accessibility which Mr. Smith seeks to remove. His other textbooks are: 

- [ ] [forallx: R<sup>3</sup>](https://github.com/ProfDavisSmith/forallxR3#readme) A Remixed, Revised, and Reimagined Introduction to Formal Logic
- [ ] [Who Should I Be? What Should I Do?](https://github.com/ProfDavisSmith/WSIBWSID#readme) An Introduction to Ethics

Outside of his OER textbooks, his current projects relate to the plausibility of libertarian free will, the philosophy of rhyme, and the philosophy of profanity.
